*Replaces **Location** and **Alphabet** in LATCH*

These are notes that are grouped together related to a specific situation you will encounter at an unpredictable time. They work a little bit like Time except there is no requirement to schedule them in advance. You just access the information as needed when you encounter the context, enabling you to act on the fly. For example, you might have notes here about what to do when need to shop for gifts.
