> [!INFO] INFO: This thought is changing...
> As I progress with my digital garden and zettelkasten system I realise I'm naturally moving towards the CODE framework  (Capture, Organise, Distill, Express), described by Tiago Forte in his book [Building a Second brain](https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/)

The first elements of a Zettelkasten involve capturing, nurturing, and sharing.
## Capture
To capture I have a simple note app that takes in all my random thoughts. I call this my "Mind Dump".
## Nurture
To nurture, each day I look at this random collection of notes, thematically organize them and paste the contents into a file that's related to the content using my [[blog/Time Context Category Heirarchy\|Time Context Category Heirarchy]] method. Then I choose some areas I wish to clarify and organize these thoughts into coherent ideas. Turning each thought into an individual note.
## Share
Finally, through this book, I express these thoughts. The process of that refines my thinking and leads me further to nurture my ideas.
