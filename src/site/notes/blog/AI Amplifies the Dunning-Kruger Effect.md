The Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias where people with limited knowledge or skill in a particular area tend to overestimate their competence in that domain. Thanks to AI, it is now possible to write reports on topics you know nothing about. Just look at cURLs' problem with [sloppy AI-generated security reports](https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/07/curl_ai_bug_reports/). It's easier than ever to produce bad work while simultaneously thinking it's great. Without doing the hard work, you don't get better, you never improve, and you stay stuck at whatever randomly-generated ceiling AI gives you.

*Note.* I've since learned that I'm the millionth person to independently come up with this idea.
