In digital gardens, posts are connected to other posts through related themes, topics, and shared context. Their relationship is topographical instead of chronological. Both the destination and source pages are visible to the reader. These links grow in density over time, which might become overwhelming, so other means of navigating are included, like a search bar and a visual node graph.
