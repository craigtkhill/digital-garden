I fell down a rabbit hole around digital gardens. I love the thought of allowing ideas to grow and evolve, without the constraints of [[blog/Navigating the Digital Garden\|linear organisation]]. I want to build a richly linked landscape that increasingly blossoms over time. It's so easy to get lost following Wikipedia links. Imagine something similar, yet more personal and experimental.

Digital gardens are hyperlinking at their best.
