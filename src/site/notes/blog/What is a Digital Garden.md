I fell down a rabbit hole around digital gardens. I love the thought of allowing ideas to grow and evolve, without the constraints of [[blog/Navigating the Digital Garden\|linear organisation]]. I want to build a richly linked landscape that increasingly blossoms over time. It's so easy to get lost following Wikipedia links. Imagine something similar, yet more personal and experimental. Digital gardens are a vision of an alternative internet, how it could have been if we weren't dominated by Millennial Promote Your Personal Brand™ blogs and behaviorally addictive and morally questionable algorithmic slop streams. Digital gardens are hyperlinking at their best. [[blog/Why use a Digital Garden\|Choose]] and explore in a way more natural to how the human brain thinks, by curiously following your neurotically networked hypergraph.
