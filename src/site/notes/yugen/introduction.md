I've been world-building for 15+ years. It allows me to play what-ifs with the world we live in and imagine how things could be. It's a creative outlet, intellectual playpen, and can serve as material for other future projects (speculative fiction, roleplay games etc). What I'm most curious to play with are the knowns and unknowns, the world that appears and the world that is cryptic or Kryptós (κρυπτός). What appears on the surface is different from how it actually is. The Phenomena in this world are known, but the causes are not. This is why I call this universe Yūgen (幽玄). 

> In Japanese aesthetics, **Yūgen** refers to a profound, mysterious sense of the beauty of the universe—specifically, beauty that is only partially perceived.

The world appears beautiful, and the documentation I share will be true to the people of this world, but that does not mean it is the Truth. The clues to the _Kryptós_ (κρυπτός) are there, hidden in plain sight within the folklore and the physics. The most honest way to view reality is through a distorted lens. This project is an exercise in that distortion. It is a world built on a secret, where the beauty comes not from knowing the answers, but from reveling in mysterious beauty.

> I've a lot of material hidden in the Kryptós side of the equation. Bit by bit, I will add the Phaneros or the visible Phenomena.
