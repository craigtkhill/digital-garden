As a developer...
- I want a pair programmer who helps me improve my coding skills, so that I can learn better practices and techniques through our collaboration.
- I want a pair programmer who reviews and validates the code, so that I can catch errors and improve code quality.
- I want to work with immediate feedback, so that I can validate code quickly and avoid wasting time moving slowly in big, imprecise steps.
- I want to achieve a flow state so that I can be maximally productive and engaged with my work.
- I want to refine the code line-by-line in real time, so that I can catch issues immediately rather than dealing with large, error-prone walls of code.
- I want to understand the codebase and how it functions, so that I can maintain full ownership and knowledge of my system.
- I want to maintain full control over system architecture and design decisions, so that the overall structure reflects my vision and requirements.

As far as I can tell in my research, no one else is implementing AI to meet these requirements. The direction we are collectively heading has become so painful that I find myself in desperate need to try something different.

The goal is to make programming fun again, and who knows, maybe it will give me an advantage in reducing the amount of slop I need to clean up.
