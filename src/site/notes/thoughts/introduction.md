This is my _[[thoughts/Digital Garden/What is a digital garden\|digital garden]]._ This garden contains notes, or as I call them, **thoughts** written in my [[thoughts/Zettelkasten/Introduction\|zettelkasten note taking system]]. This overview page contains links to other notes in the garden that may be useful starting points. However, I encourage you to navigate via the [[thoughts/Zettelkasten/Connecting Ideas\|links]], search, or the graph, and explore my tangled growth mind.
