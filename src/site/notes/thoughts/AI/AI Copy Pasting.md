The number one slop stopper is to stop copy/pasting code. When AI isn't changing large sections of your code, you are forced to read and understand what it is doing. So keep the slop out of your IDE and find ways to make it harder for you to copy/paste code. Use AI, let it show you how to do something, but never copy/paste large blocks of code.
