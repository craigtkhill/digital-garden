I've been having a lot of thoughts about AI lately. These thoughts on how we are using AI having been prompted by a singular feeling. Sure, we can argue that developers are losing their precision, creativity, autonomy, but most severely for me coding has for the first time become  **not fun**.

There was a branching point at which using AI to help write code stopped being fun. This was around the time that developers started trading Copilot's basic line completion for more cursor-style vibe coding IDEs.

I notice that as LLMs take bigger and bigger steps, the quality of their output declines. Sure, they might do fantastically on benchmarks, but their benchmarks do not match my real-world use case.

I subscribe to a healthy mix of critics and optimists in my AI reading diet, and I consider myself equal parts AI skeptic, AI advocate but I try to hold in my mind that the current models and algorithms are less Artificial Intelligence and more *Articulate Idiots*.

It does so much so well on the surface but when I dig a little deeper, and have done enough reading and studying to be opinionated about a topic, I find so much of what it outputs is wrong or substandard. And with longer and longer outputs to audit, this becomes frustrating.

So I can't rely on their APIs for a stable workflow. I'm not saying we should stop using AI for development. But we should stop relying on it. I don't want AI tools that write all the code. I want tools to write the code the way I want to write it.

*From Andrej Karpathy's talk at Y Combinator, showing his (evolving) approach to AI-assisted development workflows. The software community is still figuring out how to properly integrate these AI tools, and there's genuine uncertainty about best practices.*

*Despite Karpathy's reputation as a vibe coder, he and myself believe that letting LLMs generate large chunks of code is problematic, especially in projects where code quality and precision matter. We need to figure out how to use it in a controlled, step-by-step collaboration instead of letting it run wild. Source: Karpathy, A. (2025).
