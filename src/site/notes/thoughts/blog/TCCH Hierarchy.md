This is where things get interesting. In your categories, you can break ideas into themes with as many layers of depth as you like. I suggest you tackle this iteratively and over time, simultaneously, bottom up and top down. You want your broad categories to emerge as you merge and split ideas apart and group them into themes. Keep going until your ideas can't be split apart and your broad themes are mutually exclusive. This will leave you with a hierarchy of notes with different levels of abstraction going right down to the most fine-grained. These are the atoms that you can now reassemble and link into an interesting chemistry of ideas.
