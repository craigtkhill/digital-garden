Coding has, for the first time, become **not fun**. Our creativity, autonomy, and precision have been traded for code reviews, context switching, and duplicated code that works through some alchemy you're afraid to disturb.

There was a branching point at which using AI to help write code stopped being fun. This was around the time that developers started trading Copilot's basic line completion for a more cursor-style vibe coding IDEs.

I notice that as LLMs take bigger and bigger steps, the quality of their output declines. Sure, they might do fantastically on benchmarks, but their benchmarks do not match any [[thoughts/blog/Software Engineering Goals\|real-world use case]].

I subscribe to a healthy mix of critics and optimists in my AI reading diet, and I consider myself equal parts AI skeptic, AI advocate, but I try to hold in my mind that the current models and algorithms are less Artificial Intelligence and more *Articulate Idiots*.

It does so much so well on the surface, but when I dig a little deeper, and have done enough reading and studying to be opinionated about a topic, I find so much of what it outputs is wrong or substandard. And with longer and longer outputs to audit, this becomes frustrating.

So it's difficult to rely on their APIs for a stable workflow. I'm not saying we should stop using [[thoughts/blog/Keep AI on the leash\|AI for development]]. [[thoughts/blog/Limit AI Use\|But we should stop relying on it]]. I don't want AI tools that write all the code. I want tools to [[thoughts/blog/Requirements for a better AI collabration\|help me write better code]].
