A *Zettelkasten* (German for "Note Box") is a garden for growing and [[thoughts/blog/Connecting Ideas\|connecting ideas ]] you accumulate throughout your life. Over time, it builds and becomes an architecture to structure your philosophy, help you to solve problems, and guide decisions.

Rather than scatter your digital knowledge throughout different projects, a Zettelkasten acts as your central knowledge management repository. It is the one place where everything you learn goes, regardless of the project you are working on.

Over time, your system will become more [[Zettelkasten Simplicity\|personalized]] and work with you.

Think of consuming information as panning for gold; the more you pan, the more small amounts of gold build in the pan. You don't need to take notes on everything. Your system doesn't need to get bloated with information. You just need to pan for the few nuggets of gold that touch you every day in your digital garden's stream of thoughts to reap the benefits.

And this [[thoughts/blog/What is a digital garden\|digital garden]] will show you how to unlock the gold rush.
