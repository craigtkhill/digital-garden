*TCCH: A Latch Method alternative*

The LATCH method is an acronym that stands for **L** - Location, **A** - Alphabet,  **T** - Time, **C** - Category, **H** - Hierarchy. This is a framework created by information architect Richard Saul Wurman for organizing information. While it works well for considering the various ways we can organize information, I have tweaked it to make it work like a process to quickly decide where to put my notes in relation to each other.
