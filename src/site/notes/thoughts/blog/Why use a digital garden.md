I have a lot of thoughts, a lot of projects, and ideas. Enough to write blogs for the next five to ten years. However, I have nobly failed to "promote my personal brand and market myself in an SEO optimized way". My main goal with digital gardening is to share more of my portfolio of work, get feedback, and think more deeply. Putting your thoughts out into the ether means you [should] refine them into something coherent. Digital gardens build on the ideas of commonplace books, zettelkasten, PKM, and [[thoughts/blog/Navigating the digital garden\|hyperlinking]], allowing thoughts to evolve slowly, bottom up, linking ideas into something unique and special.
