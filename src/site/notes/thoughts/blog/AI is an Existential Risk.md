The [AI Risk Repository](https://airisk.mit.edu/) lists over 1600 potential risks that advanced AI systems could pose. AI has quietly ignited an arms race between nation-states for dominance. All of the world's leaders will have to go along for a very long time without acting stupidly to prevent the fall of humanity (the probability of which is unlikely). AI has already transformed the battlefield of Ukraine, making whole classes of equipment like naval ships obsolete and others like tanks less effective, resulting in a stalemate [^1]. In a total war, using AI to gain a battlefield advantage is always on the table, even with the catastrophic risks. Nuclear weapons had the advantage of mutually assured destruction. With AI, humans in their fight for survival will escalate their use, unleashing more potent killing machines until their last stand. I'm not saying we end up with a Terminator-like scenario, but the realistic scenario of constant attack from 1000s of aerial drones and machine gun-toting robodogs is highly likely. If we do not achieve world peace soon, our stupidity will lead us to make AI that destroys the world.
