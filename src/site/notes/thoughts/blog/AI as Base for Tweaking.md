One antidote to the loss of precision might be to use AI to generate things and then human artists fine-tune and tweak it to match their creative vision. Imagine you can generate characters or other game assets for a virtual world in seconds, creating a rough starting point and then use hard-won skills to delicately mould this template into exactly what you want. I'm inspired by open models like [Hunyuan3D](https://3d-models.hunyuan.tencent.com/world/) to generate 3D assets. However, when you have a creative vision, it's very difficult to articulate that vision exactly in words for a generative model to get exactly right. Therefore, humans will still need valuable crafting skills. These models will save hours. If you want background items to fill your game world, you will no longer need to painstakingly craft each item. But if you have a design for a beautiful vase in mind, you can easily generate a foundation mesh and add flourishing touches. Therefore, we should focus on learning (and building) the right tools to edit the work of AI and creating compatible interfaces between prompting and tweaking.
