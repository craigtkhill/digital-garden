![Karpathy's AI-assisted coding workflow](/img/user/IMAGES/keep-agents-on-leash.png)
*From Andrej Karpathy's talk at Y Combinator, showing his (evolving) approach to AI-assisted development workflows. The software community is still figuring out how to properly integrate these AI tools, and there's genuine uncertainty about best practices.*

*Despite Karpathy's reputation as a vibe coder, he and myself believe that letting LLMs generate large chunks of code is problematic, especially in projects where code quality and precision matter. We need to figure out how to use it in a controlled, step-by-step collaboration instead of letting it run wild. Source: Karpathy, A. (2025).
