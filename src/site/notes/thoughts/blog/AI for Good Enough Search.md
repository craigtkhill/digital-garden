AI is useful when you have no clue how to do something and want to get to an answer quickly. But it is useless for finding optimal answers. If you are pressed for time and you don't care enough about an answer to invest more time into it, then AI is certainly better than traditional web search or following your gut. If it is something more serious, then you will need to check your answers.
