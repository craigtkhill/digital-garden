AI is terrible, especially if you ask it about a domain you know nothing about. But if you know a domain very well and ask the right questions, it can reveal insights that can help you make breakthroughs. Granted, 90% of its suggestions will be pure hocum but if you know your stuff, AI can still be helpful, and you can identify a little golden nugget to explore. Always check its sources. AI does make progress in deep technical challenges. Google DeepMind created AlphaEvolve, an AI system that found an algorithm to multiply 4x4 complex-valued matrices using 48 scalar multiplications, improving upon Strassen's 1969 algorithm. You should think about this sort of discovery exactly like evolution; the probability of a new discovery or improvement is extremely small, so if you are prepared to burn down the rainforest and you know how to evaluate an answer is correct, you can make a breakthrough, hopefully that breakthrough is on how not to burn down the rainforest.
