There's busy work that isn't valuable. That is, it doesn't produce any measurable impact for yourself or the business. But it still needs to get done. This can be general tasks, something as simple as writing an email, marketing, AB testing... whatever is **not** the most important thing you need to do. With AI, we can become generalists and specialists, letting AI *automate the boring stuff* while we execute on the critical tasks and deliver value. The task needs to be simple, simple enough for AI to have a chance, but not so simple as to be done faster without AI.   Like finding and removing illegal racial clauses in legal documents that would take a single human 10 years, but takes a finetuned model 6 days to [review](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/stanford-and-princeton-researchers-fine-tune-a-language-model-to-identify-racial-discrimination-in-property/). It might be less accurate, but there are some use cases where it is clear that the benefit of AI outweighs the drawbacks. The skill is identifying and knowing how to *automate the boring stuff*, while turning your attention to the important value-adding stuff.
