# Capture Nurture Share
The first elements of a Zettelkasten involve capturing, nurturing, and sharing.
##  Capture
To capture I have a simple note app that takes in all my random thoughts. I call this my "Mind Dump".
## Nurture
To nurture, each day I look at this random collection of notes, thematically organize them and paste the contents into a file that's related to the content. Then I choose some areas I wish to clarify and organize these thoughts into coherent ideas. Turning each thought into an individual note.
## Share
Finally, through this book, I express these thoughts.
The process of which refines my thinking and leads me further to nurture my ideas.
