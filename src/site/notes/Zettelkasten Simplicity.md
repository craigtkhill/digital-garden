When you look online at other people's Zettelkasten systems, you'll notice each system is unique and personalized. And it should be. The workflow for your Zettelkasten should grow from your personal experience and needs as you use it. However, it can be daunting starting out, looking at how almost everyone makes their process super complicated. They take notes of everything they read. They spend hours writing their notes. And hours more fiddling with their processes. 

You don't need this. You need a system that's simple, portable, efficient, and practical. My process is much simpler. *[[thoughts/blog/Capture Nurture Share\|Capture, Nurture, and Share]]*. Just read and listen and observe with a question in mind, and write down what seems insightful and useful to you. Over time, you will develop an intuition to capture only that which resonates with you. The goal is not to convert you to my system but to give ideas to those interested. Zettelkasten systems are like dotfiles; the right one is the one that suits you.
