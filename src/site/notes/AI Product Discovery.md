If AI has an impact on software engineering, it will transform engineers into more of a product owner role. AI will need humans to guide it towards useful products. There is always work to make products and services better. Some of the technical details can be abstracted by AI, but they will still need to be told the requirements. Software engineers are not paid to make nicely designed, easily testable software. They are paid to create some kind of business value for the organizations that employ them. This is one of the tensions that is at the heart of the relationship between the more business-focused people and the more technically focused people in most traditional organizations. But if you could have your cake and eat it too. If you could work on the problems and solutions that affect you or your users, while the AI pumps out the [[AI Software Engineering Template\|functional, well-designed, and architected code]]. This would be a holy grail. It might be possible, and I'm certainly willing to put a non-trivial amount of effort into trying to figure it out. But right now we are a loooooong way off.
