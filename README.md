# Craig Hill's Digital Garden

## 🌱 About
A personal digital garden exploring ideas that emerge from connections made within my zettelkasten - a knowledge management system that helps connect ideas and foster deep thinking. Rather than traditional chronological blogging, content here grows organically from the connections and patterns that emerge from my notes and experiences.

## 🏗️ Built With

- [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/) - Static site generator
- [Digital Garden Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden)
- + Personal customizations
